#Automatic music generation with sonic Pi and Recurrent Neuronal Networks (RNNs)

Sonic Pi is a code-based music creation and performance tool and it is really awesome, rather than me writing check this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1m0aX9Lpts) out to see it in action.

Lately, I have been learning the main concepts of RNNs thanks to this great [course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice)  by the one and only [Laurence Moroney](http://www.laurencemoroney.com/), so, the question is clear:
Can I build a RNN that automatically generates sonic Pi music code?
